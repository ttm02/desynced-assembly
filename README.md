# desynced-compiler

Compiles a python code into a string to paste into the [game desynced](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1450900/Desynced_Autonomous_Colony_Simulator/) for behaviour programming.
Usage: run main.py, it will print out the resulting string to copy into the game.
Currently the filename is just hardcoded as `sample_input.py`.
See `sample_input.py` for an example
